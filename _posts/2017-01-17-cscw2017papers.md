HCI & Design at the University of Washington will again have a large and quality presence at CSCW 2017,
the premier venue for presenting research in the technical, social, material, and theoretical challenges of
designing and using technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities, and networks. 
University of Washington authors contributed to 17 papers,
with 4 selected for Best Paper Honorable Mention recognition (given to the top 5% of submissions).

This presence drawing upon more than 6 different University of Washington departments and programs.
As in all aspects of DUB, interdisciplinary perspectives are the key to great research.
Congratulations to all of these authors,
